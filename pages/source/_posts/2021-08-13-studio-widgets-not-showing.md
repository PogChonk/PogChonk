# Problems with Studio widgets not showing up?
If you ever have an issue with certain widgets not being able to show up you can check the following things:

1. Make sure you actually have the widget enabled. In the menu go to View tab and check if the required widget is enabled.
2. Check if your widget isn't already open but docked to the same position as another widget, you see tabs showing the individual widgets.
3. Check that your widget is floating around, not docked to studio.
4. Turn on your other monitors, sometimes you might have placed a floating widget on another monitor, in that case the widget will remain in that position despite the monitor being turned off, making it invisible.
5. In case you cannot get the widget to show at all, your last resort is to reset the studio widget layout. You can do this through CTRL + P (Cmd + P on Mac), and then typing in >Reset View, this will reset all the widgets in studio to their default positions.
